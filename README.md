# [Passive Aggressive Remainder] üéØ

### Project Description
[The *Passive-Aggressive Reminder* website delivers sarcastic, reverse-psychology ‚Äúencouragements‚Äù to keep you on track‚Äîby reminding you just how unlikely you are to finish. Add tasks, set reminders, and enjoy personalized passive-aggressive nudges to ‚Äúmotivate‚Äù you along the way!]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[*The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist):*  
In a world full of motivational apps and overly positive reminders, there's a glaring lack of tools for those who thrive on sarcasm and reverse psychology. Who needs encouragement when a dash of passive-aggressive realism can inspire you in a "no-pressure" way? This app ‚Äúsolves‚Äù the problem of people feeling *too motivated*‚Äîa reality check for chronic procrastinators who need a little less sunshine and a little more snark.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Introducing **Your Biggest Fan (Not Really)**‚Äîthe passive-aggressive reminder bot you didn‚Äôt know you didn‚Äôt need. This app cheerfully nudges you toward productivity by reminding you, with all the sarcasm it can muster, that you probably won‚Äôt finish anyway. Forget inspirational quotes; it‚Äôs all about a healthy dose of skepticism and sassy commentary, just enough to make you think, ‚ÄúWow, maybe I really should get this done... or not.‚Äù]
